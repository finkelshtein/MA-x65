This quantity is called the **central exposed to risk**, and is denoted $E_x^c$.\n\n- For example, if there are $100$ lives of age $x$ and if it is know that in average $1$ life dies within the next year, then $E_x^c=99.5$ (that corresponds to the \"number\" of lives at the center (middle) of the year time-interval, hence, the name).\n\n- However, in practice, we do not deal with lives of exactly the same age, hence, some lives at a moment of time $s$ may give an input to $E_x^c$, but at time $t>s$ they may impact $E_{x+1}^c$ if the birthday day took place during the time-interval $(s,t)$.\n\n- It is also important that the start of the trial (investigation) and end of the trial are not the birthday days, hence, the time-intervals when a particular life makes an input to a certain $E_x^c$ may vary.\n\n- Before considering an example, we formulate the following **principle of correspondence**:\n\na life alive at time $t$ should be included in the (central) exposed to risk number $E_x$ (impact $E_x^c$) at age $x$ at time $t$ if and only if were that life to die immediately, they would be counted in the deaths number $d_x$ at age $x$.\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=false}\n\n## 9.2 Example\nSuppose that a mortality investigation covers the period $1$ January $2015$ to $31$ December $2017$. In this study, the \"age\" means \"age last birthday\". Consider the data about $2$ males involved in the study.\n\n\n```{=latex}\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\nDOB & Joining & Exit & Reason \\\\ \\hline\n25/04/83 & 01/01/15 & 30/10/16 & D\\\\ \\hline\n04/09/82 & 22/07/17 & 04/12/17 & C\\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n```\n\n\nTherefore, the first male life joined the study at age $31$ last birthday. His life will be counted in the following central exposed to risk quantities at different moments of time (we assume here that the day of exit is not counted):\n\n\\qquad $E_{31}^c$: from 01/01/15 to 24/04/15\n\n\\qquad $E_{32}^c$: from 25/04/15 to 24/04/16\n\n\\qquad $E_{33}^c$: from 25/04/16 to 29/10/16\n\nSimilarly, the second male life joined the study at age $34$ last birthday. The contribution to the central exposed risk, hence, are:\n\n\\qquad $E_{34}^c$: from 22/07/17 to 03/09/17\n\n\\qquad $E_{35}^c$: from 04/09/17 to 03/12/17\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## 9.3 Census approximation to $E_x^c$\n\n- Let $P_{x,t}$ denote the number of lives under observation aged $x$ **last birthday**, at time $t$.\n\n- Suppose we have observation over $N+1$ calendar years of all deaths between ages $x$ and $x+1$.\nThen\n$$\nE_x^c = \\int_0^{N+1} P_{x,t}\\,dt.\n$$\n\n- Under the assumption that $P_{x,t}$ changes linearly in $t$ within each year, the value of $E_x^c$ can be approximated by the  *trapezium rule* :\n$$\nE_x^c\\approx \\frac12 \\sum_{t=0}^{N} \\bigl(P_{x,t}+P_{x,t+1}\\bigr).\n$$\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=false}\n\n## 9.4 Remark\n\nRecall that, in the above, we used \"age $x$\" as the \"age $x$ last birthday\", the value of $d_x$ should be then calculated accordingly.\n\nOne can also use the \"nearest birthday\" approach or the \"next birthday\" approach, each would require recalculation of $d_x$.\n:::\n\n",
